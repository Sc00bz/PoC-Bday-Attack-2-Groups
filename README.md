# Proof of Concept of a Birthday Attack with Two Groups
This is here so I can just point to this when I talk about the birthday attack with what I proposed as a replacement for Signal Safety Numbers to avoid leaking phone numbers. `H(pubA, pubB)` vs `sort(H(pubA, phoneA), H(pubB, phoneB))`. Both need to be the same length to provide the same security. Granted birthday attacks cost more and this is per connection not per user, but current Safety Numbers preserve a fingerprint (I.E. post your `H(pub, phone)` half publicly). To collide Safety Numbers for all comms between four different users costs 4x vs 6x for `H(pubA, pubB)`. In general it is `N` vs `(N-1)/2*N` or `O(N)` vs `O(N^2)`.
